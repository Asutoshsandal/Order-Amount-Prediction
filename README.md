# Order-Amount-Prediction
This is a machine learning project that aims to predict order amounts using various Python visualization techniques. In this project, we will explore and visualize the data, preprocess it, build a predictive model, and evaluate its performance. The primary goal is to create an accurate model that can predict order amounts based on given features.

Introduction
Order amount prediction is a common problem in e-commerce and retail industries. Accurate predictions can help businesses manage their inventory, plan marketing campaigns, and optimize their operations. In this project, we will use Python and various visualization techniques to gain insights into the data and build a predictive model for order amount prediction.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/order-amount-prediction.git
cd order-amount-prediction
Data
The dataset used in this project can be found in the data directory. It contains historical order data with various features, including customer information, product details, and order date. The target variable is the order amount.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before building a predictive model, we will perform EDA to gain a better understanding of the data. Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory contain detailed EDA notebooks. You can run them to visualize the data distribution, relationships between variables, and identify any patterns.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the data for machine learning. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. We will perform data preprocessing in the preprocessing.ipynb notebook.

Model Building
We will build a machine learning model to predict order amounts. You can find the model development code in the model.ipynb notebook. We will use scikit-learn to train and evaluate the model. Different algorithms will be explored and compared to select the best-performing one.

Model Evaluation
The model's performance will be evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. The evaluation results will be presented in the model.ipynb notebook.

Conclusion
In this project, we have explored and visualized the data, preprocessed it, built a predictive model, and evaluated its performance. The goal is to provide accurate order amount predictions that can be used by businesses for decision-making.
